    Bio<br/>
    <p>
     I'm a third-year student at Bellevue College, pursuing in a degree in Software
     Development. It's cool to find meself make progress in learning coding skill. 
     Beyond the screen, I love cooking and discovering different cuisines. In the profile picture,
     you can obviously tell I'm a dog person, so in my free time, I'd like to spend most time with my dog.
